# Tasks for Paseo

**A local task tracker in Paseo: kanban board and grouped list, subtasks, comments, attachments, and one-click delegation to a coding agent that reports back to the same task.**

Ported from the `tasks` plugin in the [BB](https://github.com/get-bb/bb) monorepo (MIT) to Paseo's native screens, panels, composer pills, timeline renderers, and daemon RPC architecture.

## Install

```bash
paseo plugin add git:anh-chu/paseo-plugin-tasks
```

Or from npm:

```bash
paseo plugin add npm:paseo-plugin-tasks
```

Requires Paseo 0.11.2 or later, and Node 24 or later on the daemon host (the store uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module).

## Quick start

1. Open **Tasks** in the sidebar, or run `/tasks` in a workspace composer.
2. Pick **Seed Sample Projects & Tasks** from the command center, or create a project under **Projects & Labels** and add a task.
3. Open a task and dispatch it with a preset under **Delegate to Agent**.
4. The agent works in place or in a new worktree, comments on the task as it goes, and sets the status when it is done.

## Delegation

A preset bundles a provider and model, a thinking level, an optional fast service tier, a permission mode, and the environment:

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Environment | `project-default` (run in the linked Paseo project) or `new-worktree` (branch a fresh git worktree from the project) |
| Permission mode | `accept-edits`, `auto`, or `full` |
| Service tier | normal or fast, when the provider supports it |

Dispatching builds a seed prompt containing the task, its description, sub-tasks, attachments, recent comments, the preset's own instructions, and anything you type in the dispatch box. The new agent session is attached to the task automatically.

Three presets ship with the plugin on first use: Codex with high thinking in a new worktree, Claude Sonnet in the default environment, and OpenCode with Gemini at high thinking. Edit them under **Agent Presets**.

## Worker report-back

Agents receive two ways to talk back to the tracker.

### `paseo-tasks` CLI

The plugin puts a `paseo-tasks` command on each agent's `PATH`, with `bb-tasks` and `bb` as aliases. Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output.

```

```

### `tasks` MCP server

The same operations are exposed as MCP tools: `tasks_projects`, `tasks_list`, `tasks_show`, `tasks_create`, `tasks_update`, `tasks_comment`, `tasks_delegate`, `tasks_attach`, and `tasks_detach`.

CLI and MCP status changes to `in_review` or `done` require a task comment for the current work cycle:

```md
**Evidence for `ABC-12`** — PASS WITH GAPS

**What ran**
Describe checks and results, or explain why none ran.

**What was not covered**
Describe gaps or blockers, or say none.
```

Choose one verdict: `PASS`, `PASS WITH GAPS`, `FAILED CHECK`, `NOTHING CHECKABLE`, or `BLOCKED`. Any verdict can enter review; `done` requires `PASS`, `PASS WITH GAPS`, or `NOTHING CHECKABLE`. Dispatching an agent or returning the card to an active state requires a new comment. This checks the comment's format; it does not verify its claims. The app's board and task controls remain available for manual changes. To disable the CLI and MCP check, set `PASEO_TASKS_REQUIRE_EVIDENCE=0` in the daemon environment.

### Task cards in replies

An agent that writes `::task{key="ABC-12"}` on its own line gets a live task card in place of that line. Clicking the card opens the task.

### Comment steering

A comment sent with **Notify agent** is delivered to the agent that last replied on the task, or to its most recently attached session, as updated context for the work in progress.

## Surfaces

| Surface | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks screen | Sidebar item, `/tasks [TASK-KEY]`, command center |
| Workspace board panel | Workspace and explorer panels, command center |
| Agent task inspector | Agent panel, `/task-panel`, composer pill |
| Composer pill | Beside the composer for each agent; shows the linked task key |

| Settings | **Settings → Plugins → Tasks** |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inject paseo-tasks CLI and MCP server | on | Adds the helper script directory to an agent's `PATH` and registers the MCP server on new agents |
| Inject Tasks reporting instructions | on | Appends the report-back contract to an agent's system prompt |
| Default view | Board | Board or grouped list when the screen opens |
| Show completed tasks on the board | on | Includes Done and Canceled columns |

## How it is built

- **Store**: one SQLite database at `$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data/tasks/tasks.db` (WAL), with migrations applied on load. Task keys are `PREFIX-NUMBER`; moving a task to another project keeps the old key as a working alias.
- **Bridge**: the plugin server serves a loopback HTTP endpoint with a random bearer token written to `$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data/tasks/bridge.json` (owner-only). It writes `paseo-tasks`, `bb-tasks`, `bb`, and `tasks-mcp.mjs` into `$PASEO_HOME/plugin-data/tasks/bin`. The CLI and MCP server refuse to run without the bridge, so the daemon is the single writer.
- **Daemon connection**: if no Paseo API context has been received yet, delegation and attachment use the installed `paseo` CLI to connect to the local daemon. The CLI must be on the daemon's `PATH`.
- **Agent wiring**: a `before` hook on agent creation injects the MCP server and the instructions; a `before` hook on session open prepends the bin directory to `PATH` and sets `BB_THREAD_ID` and `PASEO_TASK_KEY`.
- **Lifecycle**: `agent.created`, `agent.turn_started`, `agent.turn_ended`, `agent.closed`, and `agent.archived` update the tracked state of each attached session. Closing or failing writes a system comment on the task.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
paseo plugin install /path/to/paseo-plugin-tasks
paseo plugin reload tasks
```

The test suite covers the store and board moves with key aliases, cursor paging, delegation with lifecycle transitions and comment steering, the CLI and HTTP/MCP bridge, and the timeline directive transform.
